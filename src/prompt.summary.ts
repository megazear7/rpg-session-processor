Please provide a concise summary of the session audio.
Focus on the players, their actions, and events in the game at the table, not the in-world story.
Use bullet points, short sentences, and simple language so it is easy for the game master to quickly review what happened.
Do not mention the word count in the summary and do not include any "Here is your summary" preamble.
